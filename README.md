# CHIP-8 Emulator

After converting another project from Rust to Zig.
I wanted to try out Zig in another project.

For a long time I'd been wanting to write an emulator but never got to it.
This was the perfect chance to try out both.

I used [this amazing guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) for guidance.

## Running

```bash
zig build run
```

ROMs can be loaded by dropping them onto the program.
